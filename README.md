# gradeCalculatorJS
This is a project that calculates the subject grade of a learner. This project will add all your subject marks and show grade averages and show grade calculation formulas through math. It will specify how many numbers you need in each subject. Then it will present a symbol that illustrates if the learner passed the subject or failed.
